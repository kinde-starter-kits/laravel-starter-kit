# Laravel Starter Kit - Robots.txt Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Review and customize for production deployments!
# Current configuration allows full indexing - suitable for demo/development only.

User-agent: *
Disallow:

# Production Considerations:
# Consider disallowing sensitive URLs to prevent search engine indexing:
# Disallow: /login
# Disallow: /register
# Disallow: /password/
# Disallow: /admin/
# Disallow: /api/
# Disallow: /dashboard
# Disallow: /profile
# Disallow: /_ignition/
# Disallow: /telescope/
# Disallow: /horizon/

# Environment-specific handling suggestions:
# - Use Laravel's environment detection to serve different robots.txt content
# - Consider creating app/Http/Controllers/RobotsController.php to dynamically generate rules
# - For staging environments, you might want: Disallow: /
